# A Simple Hypothetical Office

This is a very simple office that was used when initially developing the code.
Because it is so simple, it is easier to reason about and simulations run
quickly.




## Contents

- ***first-office.odg***: An hypothetical (but not to scale) picture of this
  hypothetical office.

- ***office-ventilation-comparison.ipynb***: A Jupyter Notebook comparing some
  hypothetical ventilation systems for this hypothetical office.

- ***office-ventilation-comparison-single-day.ipynb***: A Jupyter Notebook
  comparing some hypothetical ventilation systems for this hypothetical office
  for a single day and which produces some different visualisations of the risk
  in the rooms in the office.

- ***simulation.ipynb***: Jupyter notebook for running various scenarios.

- ***utils.py***: Utilities for creating instances of the office and specifying
  the behaviour of agents.
