  abstract = {Aiming at problem of the high infection rate of respiratory diseases on cruise ships and the corresponding lack of quantitatively research, the Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) method is adopted in this paper to analyze the droplet transmission and dispersion process coughed by an infected passenger accommodated in an enclosed cabin quantitatively.The air flow equation is solved by solving the unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations while the Eulerian model is used to simulate the coughed droplet dispersion.The controlling effects for reducing the droplet concentration are also investigated under various conditions of changing ventilation modes and increasing ventilation rates.The results show that the displacement ventilation mode is superior to the mixed ventilation mode when increasing the ventilation rate to control the droplet dispersion.The mixed ventilation mode needs at least three air changes to empty the droplet, while the displacement ventilation mode needs only two, and the reduction of averaged droplet concentration obeys exponential distribution.In addition, the sleeping gestures of the infector have big influences on the droplet concentration in the breathing zone and inhaled dose of the susceptible.},

  abstract = {An outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in January and February 2020 in Japan. We analysed information on the cases of infection to infer whether airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, had occurred between cabins. We infer from our analysis that most infections in passengers started on 28 January and were completed by 6 February, except in those who shared a cabin with another infected passenger. The distribution of the infected cabins was random, and no spatial cluster of the infected can be identified. We infer that the ship's central air-conditioning system for passenger's cabins did not play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, i.e. airborne transmission did not occur between cabins during the outbreak, suggesting that the sufficient ventilation was provided. We also infer that the ship's cabin drainage system did not play a role. Most transmission appears to have occurred in the public areas of the cruise ship, likely due to crowding and insufficient ventilation in some of these areas.,                         Image 1},

  abstract = {Respiratory diseases are common infectious illnesses on cruise ships. This study integrated an individual-to-individual probability model, a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered epidemic model at the individual scale, and an onboard indoor social contact network model for evaluating the infection risk on a typical cruise ship voyage. The integrated model was validated by data from a previous influenza outbreak and was able to simulate the infection spreading. The model was used to assess the effects of various intervention measures on controlling influenza on a cruise ship with one index passenger. The results show that individuals in crew cabins and restaurants faced the highest infection risk. Increasing the air change rate in some or all locations could reduce the infection risk to some extent. High-efficiency particulate air filters and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation devices in ventilation systems were the most effective measures. Surgical masks worn by crew members or a quarantine of the index passenger and his/her roommate could reduce the attack rate only to a moderate extent.},
